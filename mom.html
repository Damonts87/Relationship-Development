                <p>This is my mom Stephanie. We first met a little over 20 years ago when she gave birth to me. Being my mother, she automatically was at a very deep layer in the onion. I learned how to be a person from her, so of course I tell her the most personal information about myself. </p>
                <p>As I have gotten older, my trust with her has gone up and down. There are always in situations in life, especially with your parents, that you aren't sure if you can tell them. Mostly through your teenage years your trust takes a dip.</p>

                <p>"As was noted earlier, there are clear risks involved in self-disclosure of intimate or potentially stigmatizing information if the receiver of the disclosure fails to keep that information secure." (pressbooks.pub)</p>
                <p>But now that I am older, there is no one that I trust more than my mom. There will always be things that I still dont tell her, like small details about other relationships. But if it important enough, I won't hesitate to tell her. </p>
