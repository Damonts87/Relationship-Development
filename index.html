        <h2>By Damon Sirois</h2>
        <p>Social Penetration Theory is a communication model that helps describe how we interact with different people. Also commonly referred to as the Onion Theory, this model lets you look deeper into your relationships. Like how an onion has layers, the closer and more comfortable you are to a person, the deeper into the onion they are. Getting into the deeper layers of the onion means you share more personal information with that person. </p>
        <p>
        In this analysis, I will be applying the concepts of the Social Penetration Theory and other interpersonal communication theories to three of my own personal relationships: my mother Stephanie, my best friend Hyrum, and my manager Hayley.
